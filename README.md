 SQL Data Analysis Queries Repository

 Description: This GitHub repository contains a collection of SQL queries designed to extract valuable insights from various data tables. The repository is organized into three parts, each focusing on specific data analysis tasks.

Part 1 - Basic Queries:

This section provides fundamental SQL queries to answer essential questions about the data. It includes queries to find the maximum quantity sold in a transaction, discover unique products in all transactions, and identify unique properties.

Part 2 - Advanced Analysis:

In this section, you'll find more complex SQL queries for in-depth data analysis. These queries determine the category with the maximum number of products, the state with the most stores, the top 5 product IDs with the highest sales in terms of quantity, and the top 5 property IDs with the most significant sales in terms of quantity.

Part 3 - Comparative Analysis:

The third part focuses on comparative analysis by joining multiple tables. It contains queries to find the top 5 product names with the highest sales in terms of quantity, the top 5 cities with the most substantial sales, and the top 5 products in each city based on sales quantity.

Whether you're a data analyst, SQL enthusiast, or someone looking to gain insights from structured data, this repository's queries will help you extract valuable information efficiently. Feel free to use, modify, and contribute to this collection to enhance your data analysis skills.

Explore these SQL queries to gain actionable insights from your datasets and make informed decisions.
